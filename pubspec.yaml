# The following defines the version and build number for your application. A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/BMI/
    - assets/images/FlagNutrition/
    - assets/images/Fruit/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
